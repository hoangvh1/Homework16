4 files (app.js, d3.html, data.csv, index.html) are in the main directory. 
The 2 "styles" files are in the "assets" folder.

*Please contact me if any issues. Now i don't see the "assets" folder in the "Homework16" directory. But it may hide somewhere. I did upload the folder at the same time but getting issues when doing so.
